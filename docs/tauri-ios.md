# Tauri iOS build

The iOS build belongs to this repository root. The Tauri project is `src-tauri`, and it packages the frontend from the `client` submodule.

## Local build

iOS builds require macOS with the full Xcode app installed.

```bash
nix-shell
bun run ios:build --export-method development
```

Without Nix:

```bash
./scripts/ios-build.sh --export-method development
```

Useful environment variables:

- `APPLE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`: Apple Developer Team ID used by Tauri/Xcode signing.
- `QXP_RUNTIME_CONFIG_URL`: URL used by `client/scripts/sync-runtime-config.mjs` to copy runtime server/RTC settings into the packaged app.
- `QXP_SERVER_ORIGIN`: overrides the packaged API/WebSocket origin.
- `LQXP_FORCE_IOS_INIT=1`: regenerates the Tauri Apple project before building.

The IPA is generated under:

```text
src-tauri/gen/apple/build/arm64/
```

## Development on a simulator or device

```bash
nix-shell
bun run ios:dev -- --open
```

## GitHub Actions signing secrets

The existing `Build And Release` workflow builds the signed IPA in `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`.
Configure:

- `APPLE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64`
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`
- `APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` optional

Example encoding commands on macOS:

```bash
base64 -i Certificates.p12 | pbcopy
base64 -i LQXP.mobileprovision | pbcopy
```
